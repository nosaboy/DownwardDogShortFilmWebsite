                <div class="title">Meet Martin</div>
                <p>Have you ever wondered what goes on in the mind of a dog? 
                    What would they think about everyday?  Or what they would say 
                    to you if they could speak? In Downward Dog, director Michael 
                    Killen opens a window to these hypothetical questions through 
                    Martin, a devoted and curious stay-at-home dog who ponders the 
                    mysteries of life. Through Martin’s eyes, we glimpse the beauty, 
                    humor, and sorrows of everyday life. Recently, Martin has become 
                    concerned with his beloved owner, Nan. Who has become distant due 
                    to her increasing workload. With a touch of whimsy and a dose of 
                    philosophy, Martin embarks on a journey of self-discovery, offering 
                    viewers an emotional experience that’s both introspective and 
                    heartwarming. Prepare to be swept into Martin’s world as he explores 
                    the essence of life with the sincerity only a dog could bring!

                <div class="title">Friendship</div>
                <p>Balancing friendship dynamics is often a delicate act. It is rooted 
                    in human nature that we instinctively assign value to those around 
                    us, shaping how we feel and respond to each relationship. In this 
                    chapter, Martin reflects on his struggles to find equilibrium with Nan. 
                    Although he cares deeply for her, he feels a lack of reciprocity that leaves 
                    him feeling undervalued. Martin sees himself as a “people pleaser,” often too 
                    hesitant to assert his needs or feelings. This tampers with his dynamic with Nan,
                    especially when he feels Nan overlooks them. As he wrestles with this imbalance, 
                    he contemplates ways to capture her attention, hoping to restore a sense of 
                    mutual dependency in their relationship.

                <div class="title">Walking</div>
                <p>We’ve all experienced loneliness at some point. In this chapter, Martin 
                    opens up about his feelings of isolation. With Nan dedicating more time 
                    to her studies, their moments together have become sparse, leaving Martin 
                    feeling overlooked. When a close friend drifts away to follow a different 
                    path, it can sting, as if the connection you held dear was simply a passing 
                    interest to them. Martin wrestles with guilt for these thoughts, knowing 
                    everyone deserves to pursue their own passions, yet the ache of loneliness 
                    and the lingering sense of abandonment continue to deteriorate his mind as 
                    he navigates these complex emotions.

                <div class="title">Aging</div>
                <p>We often reflect on who we were and wonder about who we’ll become. We imagine 
                    what life might look like in a decade or recall the dreams we had when we were 
                    younger. In this chapter, Martin reflects on his younger self, a time when life 
                    felt uncomplicated. He longs for those days spent running freely along the shore,
                    savoring the fresh ocean air. Now, at seven, he’s growing older; he notices the
                    fatigue that now replaces the boundless energy he once had. Aging has crept up 
                    quietly, reminding him of the changes time brings for all of us.

                <p>Have you ever felt the urge to do something purely for your own satisfaction, 
                    even if it defies society’s standards? In this chapter, Martin delves into 
                    the thrill of rebellion. He dreams of breaking free from expectations, choosing 
                    to act on his own impulses rather than adhering to Nan’s rules. It’s a desire 
                    to shatter the glass that separates him from truly following his instincts. 
                    So, would you knock over that glass to embrace a moment of freedom?

                    Every relationship has its cherished routines, moments that foster closeness. 
                    In this chapter, Martin observes that Nan seems to have lost interest in their 
                    morning "special time" together. But as he reflects, Martin begins to see Nan 
                    in a new light, realizing she may be more present and caring than he assumed. 
                    This shift fills him with gratitude, bringing a renewed sense of joy and relief. 
                    Sometimes, those who seem distant may care more deeply than we realize.

                    For Martin, it’s the joy of riding in the car with Nan. In this chapter, he 
                    reflects on these drives and begins to question whether he’s been overanalyzing 
                    her every action. Realizing that life might be simpler than he once thought, 
                    Martin concludes that true happiness lies in embracing the present moment and 
                    enjoying what feels right. When we stop overcomplicating the small details, 
                    life opens up, inviting us to experience more joy in the here and now.

                    seen as a setback, Martin chooses to view it positively, gaining newfound clarity
                    about the trivial nature of life’s worries. This shift in perspective helps him 
                    let go of unnecessary stress. With Nan now spending more time with him, Martin 
                    finds contentment and peace, savoring the simple moments they share. As the 
                    chapter closes, he feels truly fulfilled, embracing life with a light heart and 
                    appreciating the beauty of living in the present.
